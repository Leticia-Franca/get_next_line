# Get_Next_Line

The goal with this project is to create a function that'll read a file and return it **line per line**.  
With this, you'll:  
- Learn about file descriptors(fd) and static variables  
- Have some headaches with double pointers and free() (but you'll become stronger)  
- Valgrind. That's all I have to say  
- If you came from the Libft project, because get_next_line is a comfortable step up, creating a flowchart for it is a nice practice  

Now, let's go to some study links!
